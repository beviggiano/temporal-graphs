In this practical work, we will explore and implement algorithms in temporal graphs, focusing on the analysis of a dynamic system represented by the 
network of villages and connections of the fictional nation of Baiconia. Our goal is to develop a C++ program that allows us to determine the minimum distance between villages, 
the minimum year in which all distances can be traveled simultaneously, the first year in which the entire kingdom is reachable from the royal palace, and the lowest cost required to connect all villages. 
The proposed solution will include the use of classical graph theory algorithms, such as Dijkstra and Kruskal, adapted to take into account the specific temporal restrictions of this problem.
